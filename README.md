## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction [^](#top)
In this report I'll be performing three tasks:

* A [summary](https://www.github.com/tzaddik/web-hosting-guide/blob/master/1-Online_Purchase.md) of an online purchasing experience on an e-commerce site. I will be performing this on Booktopia, a website which sells books, DVDs, magazines and much more.
* A [comparison](https://www.github.com/tzaddik/web-hosting-guide/blob/master/2-Web_Host_Comparison.md) of three web hosting providers. I will be rating each provider in ten different categories to see which one offers the best features with their economy web hosting plans.
* A series of [guides](https://www.github.com/tzaddik/web-hosting-guide/blob/master/3-Website_Administrative_Procedures.md) for how to perform website administrative using the web hosting provider SiteGround.

### Online Purchasing
I found Booktopia to be a highly effective e-commerce website. They have gone out of their way to make it as easy as possible for even a novice internet user to be able to find and purchase whatever item they are looking for.

In my report I detailed a step-by-step process from entering the website, to paying and being invoiced for my purchase.

I also looked at why Booktopia is such a good e-commerce website. From it's highly effective navigation to the advanced filters and search functions that allow the users to quickly find the items they are looking for.

### Web Host Comparison
I reviewed three different web hosting companies, Panthur, SiteGround and Netregistry.

Comparing them across ten different categories I found SiteGround to be the best web host of the three. This was because SiteGround offer excellent value for money, giving a user premium features at very low prices in comparison to other web hosts.

### Website Administrative Procedures
In this report I presented small how-to guides for common website administrative procedures. These include domain, database, and file management tasks.

I used SiteGround for this task as I have an account with them so could take screenshots of the back-end. I also used their huge Knowledgebase which contains articles on how to do pretty much any task a web admin could possibly want to perform.

### Conclusion
All up I found writing this report very informative. I learned how to:

* Review the technical capabilities of a website
* Select a web hosting company that suits my needs.
* Get a look at what kind of knowledge is required to operate a website.
