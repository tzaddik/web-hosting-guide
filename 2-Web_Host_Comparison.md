# Web Hosting Websites Comparison â€“ Panthur, SiteGround & Netregistry
I have chosen the web hosting companies Panthur, SiteGround and Netregistry for my web host comparison.

This is because I have experience with all three, using web hosting from SiteGround and Netregistry and domain name registration with Panthur.

I'm going to review the services they provide under each of the ten categories as seen in the Table of Contents. I'll give each company a score out of ten for each category adding up to a total rating out of a hundred in the Conclusion.

## <a name="domain"></a>Domain name service
The web server address is an IP address, which can be hard for a human to remember. A domain name is the web address a user can use to access a website instead of the IP address. The domain name servers(DNS) that form the backbone of the internet keep a record of these domain names so that when a user enters a domain name, they go to the web server they want to go to.

### Panthur
Panthur offer cheap domain name registration, the real highlight being that the .au extensions don't cost any more than the standard extensions. They start from $12 for the .com, .org and .net extensions. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround offer free domain name registration upon signing up to one of their plans. They also extend the domain registration for free whenever you renew your hosting plan. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Netregistry are the most expensive of the hosts reviewed here, but still offer fairly cheap registrations for the .au extensions starting from $17,50. **Rating: 6/10**

## <a name="privacy"></a>Privacy (DNS)
When registering a .com or .net domain name, the registrant's personal details are added to a public **WHOIS** database. To protect your privacy, it is recommended that you acquire domain privacy from your domain registrar.

The .au extensions don't allow this option due to **.au Domain Administration(auDA)** regulations.

### Panthur
Offer free domain privacy for all the standard extensions. **Rating: 10/10**

### SiteGround
An additional fee of $9,95 a year is required to make the registrant details private. **Rating: 8/10**

### Netregistry
An additional fee of $9,95 a year is required to make the registrant details private. **Rating: 8/10**

## <a name="email"></a>Email and mailing list services
One of the most useful features of buying a domain name is to be able to have your own custom email address. 

This makes your company look more professional and add a layer of privacy to your electronic correspondence.

Mailing list services are used to send out marketing materials to a customer list.

### Panthur
Offers fully unlimited email services. They allow an unlimited amount of email accounts and support forwarding, auto-responders, catch-all addresses and webmail access. **Rating: 10/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround offer unlimited email accounts and email forwarding. They also support the three most popular webmail clients, Horde, RoundCube and SquirrelMail. **Rating: 8/10**

### Netregistry
They have a limited amount of email addresses and mailbox storage based on which plan is purchased. They do support forwarding, auto-responders, catch-all addresses, webmail access and server-side anti-virus scanning. **Rating: 8/10**

## <a name="data"></a>Data capacity
This is the amount of server storage that a web hosting plan provides. Site bandwidth is also something that some web hosts limit.

For the purpose of this comparison, I'll be ranking companies based on their economy plans, what they offer for small to medium websites on shared servers.

### Panthur
Web hosting plans with Panthur come with storage space ranging from 150MB to 40GB. The monthly bandwidth ranges from 5GB to 300GB. Due to the poor value in comparison to other web hosting companies, I've rated them lower. **Rating: 4/10**

### SiteGround
Web hosting plans with SiteGround come with storage space ranging from 10GB to 30GB. The monthly bandwidth is unlimited. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Web hosting with Netregistry come with storage space ranging from 5GB to 50GB. The monthly bandwidth ranges from 10GB to unlimited. **Rating: 7/10**

## <a name="security"></a>Security
Website Security is vitally important when it comes to picking a web hosting provider. It is even more important in a shared server environment, where websites are less secure than on their own server.

### Panthur
They have SSL certificate support to help secure your website. **Rating: 7/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround have a unique account isolation system which makes their shared server accounts as secure as dedicated servers. The more premium plans also provide a free SSL certificate in the first year and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS) compliance. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
They have SSL certificate support to help secure your website. **Rating: 7/10**

## <a name="database"></a>Scripting and Database options
Websites can be created using many different scripting languages. The most common being PHP, Perl and Python.

Data can also be stored using many different database languages. The most common being SQL and MySQL.

### Panthur
Panthur allow an unlimited amount of MySQL databases no matter which hosting plan is selected. The server comes with LAMP installed so supports PHP, Perl and Python. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround allow an unlimited amount of MySQL and PostgreSQL databases with all hosting plans. They also support multiple versions of PHP, provide PHP libraries and support Perl and Python. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Netregistry offer only a small amount of databases, between 3-10 across the economy hosting plans. They do support PHP, Perl and Python though. **Rating: 5/10**
 
## <a name="apps"></a>Server applications
Web hosts usually provide a program like cPanel to help manage all your file and database settings.

Web servers usually come with just a branded html file inside the allocated storage space. To help people build a website, especially those who want to use a Content Management System(CMS), web hosts usually provide software that help users to build these sites. This software usually does things like automate the creation of databases so less technical users can get their sites up and running with minimal fuss.

Some web hosts also provide support for Content Distribution Networks(CDN) such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com), which make your site more secure and delivered faster to visitors.

All the websites reviewed provide cPanel with their hosting plans so the review will focus on the other software they provide.

### Panthur
Offer support for **CloudFlare** to help speed up site performance and security.

Panthur have **Installatron** included with all their hosting plans. This program allows one-click creation of websites on all popular CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla and Magento.

They also provide **Site Builder Pro**, a program that helps the client build a static website from scratch following a few simple steps. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround

SiteGround have **Softaculous** installed with all their hosting plans.
