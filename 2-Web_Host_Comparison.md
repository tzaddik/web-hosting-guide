# Web Hosting Websites Comparison â€“ Panthur, SiteGround & Netregistry
I have chosen the web hosting companies Panthur, SiteGround and Netregistry for my web host comparison.

This is because I have experience with all three, using web hosting from SiteGround and Netregistry and domain name registration with Panthur.

I'm going to review the services they provide under each of the ten categories as seen in the Table of Contents. I'll give each company a score out of ten for each category adding up to a total rating out of a hundred in the Conclusion.

## <a name="domain"></a>Domain name service
The web server address is an IP address, which can be hard for a human to remember. A domain name is the web address a user can use to access a website instead of the IP address. The domain name servers(DNS) that form the backbone of the internet keep a record of these domain names so that when a user enters a domain name, they go to the web server they want to go to.

### Panthur
Panthur offer cheap domain name registration, the real highlight being that the .au extensions don't cost any more than the standard extensions. They start from $12 for the .com, .org and .net extensions. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround offer free domain name registration upon signing up to one of their plans. They also extend the domain registration for free whenever you renew your hosting plan. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Netregistry are the most expensive of the hosts reviewed here, but still offer fairly cheap registrations for the .au extensions starting from $17,50. **Rating: 6/10**

## <a name="privacy"></a>Privacy (DNS)
When registering a .com or .net domain name, the registrant's personal details are added to a public **WHOIS** database. To protect your privacy, it is recommended that you acquire domain privacy from your domain registrar.

The .au extensions don't allow this option due to **.au Domain Administration(auDA)** regulations.

### Panthur
Offer free domain privacy for all the standard extensions. **Rating: 10/10**

### SiteGround
An additional fee of $9,95 a year is required to make the registrant details private. **Rating: 8/10**

### Netregistry
An additional fee of $9,95 a year is required to make the registrant details private. **Rating: 8/10**

## <a name="email"></a>Email and mailing list services
One of the most useful features of buying a domain name is to be able to have your own custom email address. 

This makes your company look more professional and add a layer of privacy to your electronic correspondence.

Mailing list services are used to send out marketing materials to a customer list.

### Panthur
Offers fully unlimited email services. They allow an unlimited amount of email accounts and support forwarding, auto-responders, catch-all addresses and webmail access. **Rating: 10/10**

SiteGround offer unlimited email accounts and email forwarding. They also support the three most popular webmail clients, Horde, RoundCube and SquirrelMail. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
They have a limited amount of email addresses and mailbox storage based on which plan is purchased. They do support forwarding, auto-responders, catch-all addresses, webmail access and server-side anti-virus scanning. **Rating: 7/10**

## <a name="data"></a>Data capacity
This is the amount of server storage that a web hosting plan provides. Site bandwidth is also something that some web hosts limit.

For the purpose of this comparison, I'll be ranking companies based on their economy plans, what they offer for small to medium websites on shared servers.

### Panthur
Web hosting plans with Panthur come with storage space ranging from 150MB to 40GB. The monthly bandwidth ranges from 5GB to 300GB. Due to the poor value in comparison to other web hosting companies, I've rated them lower. **Rating: 4/10**

### SiteGround
Web hosting plans with SiteGround come with storage space ranging from 10GB to 30GB. The monthly bandwidth is unlimited. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Web hosting with Netregistry come with storage space ranging from 5GB to 50GB. The monthly bandwidth ranges from 10GB to unlimited. **Rating: 7/10**

## <a name="security"></a>Security
Website Security is vitally important when it comes to picking a web hosting provider. It is even more important in a shared server environment, where websites are less secure than on their own server.

### Panthur
They have SSL certificate support to help secure your website. **Rating: 7/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround have a unique account isolation system which makes their shared server accounts as secure as dedicated servers. The more premium plans also provide a free SSL certificate in the first year and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS) compliance. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
They have SSL certificate support to help secure your website. **Rating: 7/10**

## <a name="database"></a>Scripting and Database options
Websites can be created using many different scripting languages. The most common being PHP, Perl and Python.

Data can also be stored using many different database languages. The most common being SQL and MySQL.

### Panthur
Panthur allow an unlimited amount of MySQL databases no matter which hosting plan is selected. The server comes with LAMP installed so supports PHP, Perl and Python. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround allow an unlimited amount of MySQL and PostgreSQL databases with all hosting plans. They also support multiple versions of PHP, provide PHP libraries and support Perl and Python. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Netregistry offer only a small amount of databases, between 3-10 across the economy hosting plans. They do support PHP, Perl and Python though. **Rating: 5/10**
 
## <a name="apps"></a>Server applications
Web hosts usually provide a program like **cPanel** to help manage all your file and database settings.

Web servers usually come with just a branded html file inside the allocated storage space. To help people build a website, especially those who want to use a Content Management System(CMS), web hosts usually provide software that help users to build these sites. This software usually does things like automate the creation of databases so less technical users can get their sites up and running with minimal fuss.

Some web hosts also provide support for Content Distribution Networks(CDN) such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com), which make your site more secure and delivered faster to visitors.

All the websites reviewed provide cPanel with their hosting plans so the review will focus on the other software they provide.

### Panthur
Offer support for **CloudFlare** to help speed up site performance and security.

Panthur have **Installatron** included with all their hosting plans. This program allows one-click creation of websites on all popular CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla and Magento.

They also provide **Site Builder Pro**, a program that helps the client build a static website from scratch following a few simple steps. **Rating: 8/10**

### SiteGround
Offer support for **CloudFlare** to help speed up site performance and security.

SiteGround have **Softaculous** installed with all their hosting plans. This program allows for the one-click creation of websites on all popular CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla and Magento.

They also have a program called **SPAM Experts** which provides protection for incoming and outgoing emails. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Their features list doesn't mention which program they use, but it does say that they support the one-click installation of all the major CMS.
They provide a program called  **Website Builder**, that helps the client build a static website from scratch following a few simple steps. **Rating 6/10**

## <a name="performance"></a>Performance monitoring
One of the tasks many web admins perform is the monitoring of site performance. This is usually done to ensure that features on the site are functioning correctly and not causing an unnecessary overuse of server resources.

It can also mean the monitoring of web traffic, keeping track of where users are coming from, and what they are doing on your site.

### Panthur
As Panthur restricts the bandwidth usage on their economy hosting plans, they offer a bandwidth manager for their clients. This tells the user how much bandwidth they have used for the month and how close they are to exceeding it.

They also offer **Webalizer** and **AWStats**, which are advanced monitoring tools that monitors bandwidth as well as number of visitors, unique visitors, page views and hits. **Rating: 9/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround provide server performance monitoring tools, which allow the user to keep track of CPU and memory usage.

They also offer **Webalizer** and **AWStats**, which are advanced monitoring tools that monitors bandwidth as well as number of visitors, unique visitors, page views and hits. **Rating: 9/10**

### Netregistry
NetRegistry offer basic web traffic reporting and a monitoring tool to keep track of monthly bandwidth usage. **Rating: 6/10**

## <a name="backup"></a>Backup and restore services
The most important thing for a website is a proper backup routine. No matter how secure the web server, it can be hacked or lost in a disaster so the lack of a backup can destroy a website and cripple an e-commerce business.

Many web hosting companies provide solutions to help their clients perform this critical operation.

### Panthur
Panthur perform daily backups automatically of all the client's websites, and keeps these daily backups for a period of 30 days.

In the event of the client wanting one of these backups restored, it can be done using a program called **Click Restore**. **Rating: 10/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround perform daily backups automatically of all the client's websites, and keeps these daily backups for a period of 30 days.

Users on any plan but the most basic one can access these backups and restore any copy they wish to. The premium plan even offers unlimited restore support, where one of SiteGround's support staff will manually restore the site themselves, taking all the technical steps out of the process for non-technical users.

Those on the basic plan only have the latest backup kept by SiteGround, which they have to request access to if required. **Rating 9/10**

### Netregistry
NetRegistry offer tools to perform manual backups, but as far as I can see, don't offer any automated backup or restore services for their economy plans **Rating 2/10**

## <a name="commerce"></a>Payment technology options
There are many different ways to setup an e-commerce site. You can either use a CMS like **Magento** or **osCommerce** to build your site on, or use a plugin or extension into another CMS like **WordPress** or **Joomla**.

The most important feature with an e-commerce site is security, and some web host companies provide extra payment technology features to help their clients make more secure sites.

### Panthur
Panthur allow users to install an eCommerce-based CMS but don't seem to offer any extra security specifically related to payment technologies. **Rating: 6/10**

### SiteGround
SiteGround allow users to install an eCommerce-based CMS via **Softaculous**.

With their premium plan, they offer **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard(PCI DSS)** compliance. It consists of 12 security requirements, aimed at safeguarding credit card holder details, preventing credit card fraud and other security risks. It covers all credit cards with the logos of Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover or JCB. **Rating: 10/10**

### Netregistry
Netregistry allow users to install an eCommerce-based CMS but don't seem to offer any extra security specifically related to payment technologies. **Rating: 6/10**

## <a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion
As I said at the start, I have used all three of these companies and in comparison to large international web hosting providers such as **GoDaddy** and **HostGator**, they are all very good value. I would recommend any of them to someone building a website.

There is a clear winner though, as the ratings indicate. I will do a summery for each company below.

### Panthur
**Final Rating: 80**

Panthur's three main strengths in this comparison were the free domain privacy, fully unlimited email services and the highly advanced backup/restore services.

Their .au domain names are also the cheapest I have found on the internet and only got beaten out by SiteGround as they offer them free with web hosting.

The low bandwidth is what killed them in this comparison. It was still good for economy plans, but couldn't compare to what the other two companies offered.

### SiteGround
**Final Rating: 96**

SiteGround's final rating shows just how good they are in relation to their competitors.

With a heavy focus on server security and performance, SiteGround offer premium services at a very low cost. Even their cheapest plan contains an array of features such as unlimited data bandwidth, unlimited databases and unlimited email.

The only real weakness in this comparison was the cost of domain privacy. For a local website that wouldn't even matter as domain privacy isn't allowed on .au extensions.

### Netregistry
**Final Rating: 60**

Netregistry's final rating is a bit unfair as a guide for the services they offer. It is only low in comparison to the great value offered by Panthur and SiteGround.
