# Web Hosting Websites Comparison â€“ Panthur, SiteGround & Netregistry
I have chosen the web hosting companies Panthur, SiteGround and Netregistry for my web host comparison.

This is because I have experience with all three, using web hosting from SiteGround and Netregistry and domain name registration with Panthur.

I'm going to review the services they provide under each of the ten categories as seen in the Table of Contents. I'll give each company a score out of ten for each category adding up to a total rating out of a hundred in the Conclusion.

## <a name="domain"></a>Domain name service
The web server address is an IP address, which can be hard for a human to remember. A domain name is the web address a user can use to access a website instead of the IP address. The domain name servers(DNS) that form the backbone of the internet keep a record of these domain names so that when a user enters a domain name, they go to the web server they want to go to.

### Panthur
Panthur offer cheap domain name registration, the real highlight being that the .au extensions don't cost any more than the standard extensions. They start from $12 for the .com, .org and .net extensions. * Rating: 9/10 *
